This is the repo for my little project to create a CI/CD pipeline and gain experience with test results visualization tools.
My mentor at CCC helped me get started and has challenged me to continue adding to my knowledge and also to share the knowledge.

It is not very interesting because the tests are always passing, but I will be working to make this page WAY more exciting in the future.  I also want to include some UI test results from Cypress when I get to that point.

The highlights are:
1) Using Python, execute a GET on a public API on a daily basis or when PUSH is done to Git Repo.
2) Use Git Workflow to run the Python script based on cron timer or when PUSH is done.
3) Using Python evaluate the result and create output for Google Charts input.
4) Publish results to the page below when Git Workflow runs successfully.

See this page for the end result.
