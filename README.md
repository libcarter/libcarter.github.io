This is the repo for my little project to create a CI/CD pipeline and gain experience with test results visualization tools.
My mentor at CCC helped me get started and has challenged me to continue adding to my knowledge and also to share the knowledge.

It is not very interesting because the tests are always passing, but I will be working to make this page WAY more exciting in the future.  I also want to include some UI test results from Cypress when I get to that point.

See this page for the end result.
